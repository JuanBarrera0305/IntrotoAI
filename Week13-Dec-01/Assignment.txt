Consider the Bayesian network in Figure Burglary:Links to an external site.
1. If no evidence is observed, are Burglary and Earthquake independent? Prove this from the numerical semantics and from the topological semantics.
2. If we observe Alarm=true, are Burglary and Earthquake (conditionally) independent? Justify your answer by calculating whether the probabilities involved satisfy the definition of conditional independence. (Note: this is known as explaining away.)
Define a Bayesian network that captures at least 5 variables that affect your performance in this class. Try to give some idea of what the CPTs should look like.
Finally, please create a Python notebook and work out a problem using a Bayesian network for your final project using the approaches described in Chapter 13 Probabilistic Reasoning similar to the examples worked out during class. If you do not have a direct application, please extend your problem proposed to include something where planning is relevant.
