Question 1: "Define in your own words what knowledge representation is and why it is important. Include several examples in your answer."

Knowledge representation is the way in which information and also facts about the real world are put together so that a computer system can reason, 
learn, and make intelligent decisions. It is a matter of articulating real-life knowledge in a formal and logical way so that an AI system can understand and apply it during the problem-solving process. 
The idea is very important because it dictates the main ways an AI system comprehends relations, infers results, and welcomes new data as a part of its process. Examples include semantic networks that link 
concepts like “Dog → is a → Mammal,” production rules such as “IF temperature > 100°C THEN water = gas,” and first-order logic statements like ∀x [Human(x) → Mortal(x)],
which express general truths about objects and their properties. These representations allow machines to store complex knowledge, communicate with humans, and perform reasoning 
similar to human thought.

Question 2: "Define an ontology in first-order logic for tic-tac-toe. The ontology should contain situations, actions, squares, players, marks (X, O, or blank), and the notion 
of winning, losing, or drawing a game. Also define the notion of a forced win (or draw): a position from which a player can force a win (or draw) with the right sequence of actions. 
Write axioms for the domain. (Note: The axioms that enumerate the different squares and that characterize the winning positions are rather long. You need not write these out in full, 
but indicate clearly what they look like.)

An ontology for the game of tic-tac-toe using first-order logic will account for all game elements as well as their respective interrelations. Situations or board states, 
player moves or actions, squares, players, and marks (X, O, or blank) will all be accounted for in the logic. 
Actions can be depicted by the notation Move(p, q), in which 'p' represents the player who marks square 'q', and situations as 's' representing the board after each move. 
Predicates like Marked(q, m, s) tell us about the mark being m on square q in situation s, whereas Legal(Move(p, q), s)
 signifies valid actions. One of the players will win if ...

∃q₁, q₂, q₃ (Line(q₁, q₂, q₃) ∧ Marked(q₁, MarkOf(p), s) ∧ Marked(q₂, MarkOf(p), s) ∧ Marked(q₃, MarkOf(p), s)),
Line(q₁, q₂, q₃) indicates the eight different winning combinations that are possible. A draw takes place if all squares are filled up and at the same time no player has won, 
while a loss means that the other player has won. The concept of a forced win (or draw) can be shown as a condition where 
a player has series of legal moves that would guarantees a win (or draw) and no matter what the opponent does:

ForcedWin(p, s) ↔ ∃a [Legal(a, s) ∧ (Win(p, Do(a, s)) ∨ ∀a₂ (Legal(a₂, Do(a, s)) → ForcedWin(p, Do(a₂, Do(a, s)))))]
The axioms come one after another that let in the nine rectangles and eight winning lines.
