    "####**Description:**####\n",
    "\"FoodPrint is an AI app that scans menus or barcodes to estimate the **nutritional value** and **environmental impact** of what you eat.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Chapter 2 – Intelligent Agents**\n",
    "#### Why \n",
    "\"- FoodPrint acts as an intelligent agent that perceives (via camera/barcode), reasons (nutrition + impact), and acts (suggests swaps).\"  \n",
    "\"- Each user can be modeled as an agent with goals — e.g., eat healthier, reduce footprint — while the app functions as a goal-driven assistant.\"\n",
    "#### Application to FoodPrint\n",
    "\"- Define the agent’s environment: menus, packaging, and user preferences.\"  \n",
    "\"- Build rational behavior: suggest swaps that optimize both **health** and **sustainability**.\"  \n",
    "\"- Enable adaptive feedback: the agent learns from user choices over time and refines its recommendations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Chapter 4 – Search in Complex Environments**\n",
    "#### Why \n",
    "\"- Meal swaps involve multi-objective optimization — balancing taste, nutrition, carbon footprint, and availability.\"  \n",
    "\"- The system must search through large, partially observable spaces (e.g., missing ingredients, vague menu descriptions).\"\n",
    "#### Application to FoodPrint\n",
    "\"- Use **heuristics** to rank alternatives (e.g., “lower footprint but similar protein”).\"  \n",
    "\"- Handle **uncertainty**: estimate impact even when full data isn’t available.\"  \n",
    "\"- Optimize recommendations based on user constraints (e.g., vegetarian, allergies, price range).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Chapter 8 – First-Order Logic**\n",
    "#### Why \n",
    "\"- FoodPrint can represent relationships like:\"  \n",
    "\" `Contains(menuItem, ingredient)`\"  \n",
    "\" `HasImpact(ingredient, carbonScore)`\"  \n",
    "\" `SwapSuggestion(menuItem, alternativeItem)`\"  \n",

    "\" If a meal contains beef, its impact is high.”\"  \n",
    "\" If a user prefers low-impact meals, suggest plant-based swaps.”\"  \n",
